You enter several words of 3 to 8 letters and they are saved in the database --- you enter a path to create a text file and when you press start, it starts creating a password based on the words entered in the database (it puts 12 to 12 words together with a space between each word). It creates all the possible word combinations and saves 10,000 in the text file and goes to the next text file --- a kind of way to create a wallet password and you can say hack it --- I hope it is not misused and just look at the codes --- it is an interesting project, take a look, especially the MainWindow.xaml.cs file
